The Evolutionary spectrum inversion and analysis (Especia) file set provides ISO C++ code for the inverse modelling and
analysis of intergalactic and interstellar absorption line regions seen in QSO spectra.

Due to the use of evolution strategies with covariance matrix adaption, the inverse modelling procedure is highly
competitive and capable of calculating the optimal spectral decomposition without requiring any particular
initialisation.

Additional highlights are the joint modelling and optimisation of the background continuum, and an accurate
semi-analytic convolution of the absorption term with the instrumental function. The method is explained in detail by
[Quast et al. (2005)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361:20041601).

# Getting started [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/octoflar/especia.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/octoflar/especia)

Especia enables you to analyse spectroscopic data. Though it has been developed for the analysis of astrophysical
spectra, it is, in principle, applicable to spectroscopy in general. Read the notes and articles listed below to find
out whether this software is of interest to you.

If you already have some understanding of these matters, you may want to consult the
[especia wiki](https://github.com/octoflar/especia/wiki)
before you clone the [source code reposirory](https://github.com/octoflar/especia)
or download a [release version](https://github.com/octoflar/especia/releases).

Building Especia requires [CMake](https://cmake.org) and a compiler that implements
[C++11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11). For additional information on
prerequisites consult the [build instructions](https://github.com/octoflar/especia/wiki/Build-instructions).
Especia runs on various variants of macOS (including Big Sur on Intel and M1 machines)
and Linux.

To build and test the Especia software `cd` into the project root directory and type:

    mkdir cmake-build-release
    cd cmake-build-release
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
    make all test

Typing `make install` will complete the build and move the executable files into your
`$HOME/bin` directory.

# Release versions

Release versions YYYY.N are numbered by the year of the release followed by a single-digit number, which enumerates the
release within the release year. For example, version 2016.1 denotes the first release of the year 2016. The latest
release version is [2016.1](https://github.com/octoflar/especia/releases/tag/2016.1).
