## About

To optimize this model type, for instance:

    curcuma 5489 10 20 3.0 0.0001 1000 10 < na.md

Consult the Especia wiki on [using the software](https://github.com/octoflar/especia/wiki/Using-the-software)
for further help.

## Section: Na-D doublet

Doppler profiles are used here. The line parameters are:

1. laboratory wavelength (Ã…)
2. oscillator strength
3. cosmological redshift
4. radial velocity (km s-1)
5. line broadening velocity (km s-1)
6. decadic logarithm of the particle column number density (cm-2)

Consult the Especia wiki on [model definition files](https://github.com/octoflar/especia/wiki/Model-definition-files)
for further explanation.
